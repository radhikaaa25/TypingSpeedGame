## üöÄ Game Mechanics

- **WPM Calculation:**  Words are counted based on the number of space-separated segments.
WPM is calculated as:
WPM= (Number of words / Time in minutes)

- **Accuracy:**  Accuracy is determined by comparing the typed text with the given text.
Accuracy (%) = (Correct Characters / Total Characters) * 100

- **Errors:** The error count increases whenever the user types an incorrect character.
